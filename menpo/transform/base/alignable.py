class Alignable(object):
    r"""
    Mixin for Transforms that can be constructed from an
    optimisation aligning a source PointCloud to a target PointCloud.

    Construction from the align() class method enables certain features of the
    class, like the from_target() and update_from_target() method. If the
    instance is just constructed with it's regular constructor, it functions
    as a normal Transform - attempting to call alignment methods listed here
    will simply yield an Exception.

    :class:`AlignableTransform`s that are solely defined in terms of a source

    All transforms include support for alignments - all have a source and

    from_target(). However, for most transforms this is an optional
    interface - if the alignment constructor is not used, is_alignment is
    false, and all alignment methods will fail.

    This class is for transforms that solely make sense as alignments. It
    simplifies the interface down, so that :class:`PureAlignmentTransform`
    subclasses only have to override :meth:`_target_setter()`
    to satisfy the AlignableTransform interface.

    Note that if you are inheriting this class and Transform it is suggested
    that you inherit this class first, so as to get it's definitions of n_dims.
